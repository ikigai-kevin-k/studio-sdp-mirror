The game status digit of the Cammegh
gaming protocol indicates the live game
status of the wheel.

The normal game sequence operates
between states 1 to 5.

State 1 indicates the rotor is revolving in a
table closed mode, or after 3 revolutions of
the rotor after the winning number state
has occurred.

State 2 indicates the rotor is revolving and
a new game is being started.


State 3 indicates a ball has been detected
in the racetrack by all three in-rim sensors,
i.e. one revolution of the ball.

State 4 indicates the No More Bets state,
(the speed of the ball has decreased below
the set time value between in-rim
sensors).

State 5 indicates Winning Number has
been established, by all in-rim sensors
detecting the ball in a valid pocket during
state 4, with no game errors present.

State 6 indicates that the table is closed or
the wheel has been powered down.

Warning Flags:
- The warning flag outputs a live hexadecimal sum value of occurring faults.
- Value 1: warning flag indicates the ball has been removed from the wheel or has not been sensed by the rim sensors.
- Value 2: warning flag indicates the ball is travelling in the same direction as the rotor.
- Value 4: indicates failure of an in-rim sensor, or the motor or encoder.
- Value 8 indicates a void game and failed ball launch. The controller will automatically
attempt to re-launch the ball.
